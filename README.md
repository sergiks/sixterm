AppleScript to start Terminal app on MacOS and create 6 "Pro"-themed windows tiled to fill the screen.

If Terminal is alrady open and has some windows open, it'll create only enough to meet the total of 6.

There is an AppleScript file as well as an app in the repo.


Cheers to David for inspiration!
